# hello-world

Hi there!

Kabelo is my name. I'm currently a civil engineer by profession but I'm trying to change careers and become a data scientist.
I'm currently learning Python and SQL languages and have a bit of exposure to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
I'm also learning machine learning and have a background with statistics.
I hope to become a very experienced programmer :).
